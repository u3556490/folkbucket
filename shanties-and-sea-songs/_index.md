# English shanties and song sung at sea

This series is dedicated to the captioned kind of music.

As this is an area that has decent ongoing research and public enthusiasm, there should be plenty of useful materials elsewhere online. Hence, entries are only made here if they provide something at least marginally special or original. Entries may include lyrics, additional explanatory notes, or sheet music transcriptions.

## Definitions

I think the term "shanty" should refer to a subset of songs sung by sailors at sea (alliteration almost intended) in the sense that shanties strictly refer to work songs. That is, they are sung to coordinate movement and boost morale *while performing physical labour* [1]; whereas songs that don't comply by these can be seen as folk songs about seafaring in general. Thus, the following comparison table for quick differentiation between the two kinds can be established:

|  | Shanties | Other sea songs |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Involves ideas about seafaring | Of course | Of course |
| Call-and-response format | Yes | No |
| Verse length | Shorter | Longer |
| Accompaniment texture | Thinner, can be none | Thicker |

These are based on my personal observations through my extremely limited listening. Take with a grain of salt (preferably sea salt).

Nonetheless, in our settings on land, when we're singing these songs for our enjoyment, things can still go quite swimmingly even if you have to sing the call-and-response all by yourself with a guitar in your hand to back you up.
