# The Leaving of Liverpool

Roud 9435 [1].

## Lyrics

The following is the lyrical transcription of the version sung by Rory McEwen, Martin Carthy, Paul McNeill [a], and Bob Davenport on 1963-12-07 on the TV programme *Hullabaloo* [1], presented by Rory McEwen. [2]

> (ALL)  
> Farewell to dear old Liverpool,  
> River Mersey, fare thee well.  
> I'm bound to California [n1],  
> A place that I know well.  
>
> (Refrain, ALL)  
> So fare thee well, my own true love,  
> When I return, united we will be.  
> It's not the leaving of Liverpool that grieves me,  
> But my darling, when I think on thee.  
>
> (Carthy)  
> I am bound for California,  
> By way of the stormy Cape Horn.  
> And I'll write to you a letter, love,  
> When I am homeward bound.  
>
> (Refrain)  
>
> (Davenport)  
> Well I've shipped aboard a Yankee clipper ship,  
> *Davy Crockett* is her name [n2].  
> And Burgess is the captain of her,  
> He's a sod, and the ship's the same.  
>
> (Refrain)  
>
> (McEwen)  
> It's the second time I've sailed with Burgess,  
> And I think I know him well.  
> If a man's a sailor, he can get along,  
> But if not, then he's sure in hell.  
>
> (Refrain)  
>
> (McNeill)  
> Farewell to dear old [Lime Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lime_Street,_Liverpool) [n3],   
> Anson Terrace, and Park Lane.  
> There's only one thing that grieves my mind,  
> I may never see you again.  
>
> (Refrain)

Remarks:
- [n1] The Dubliners' version sings this word with pronunciation /ˌkæ.lɪ.ˈfɔr.naɪ.e/ [3].
- [n2] Davenport's accent sings the *NAME* vowel as a long monophthong instead of a diphthong.
- [n3] Other versions may say "Lower Frederick Street" instead.

The song is about an Englishman leaving his lover to go to California, presumably during the times of the gold rush [1]. There are alternative versions at [1, 3, 4, 5]. The metre of the verse *very* loosely falls into a ballad metre.

## Music transcription

An alternative version is available at [5]. This is obviously done before, but I'm adding my two cents for [2].

The different versions of the song are arguably very similar, and if you superimpose them on top of one another, it is quite likely that you can get a nice heterophonic effect.

## Footnotes

- [a] [Paul McNeill](https://www.mainlynorfolk.info/folk/records/paulmcneill.html)'s name seems to be omitted often by commentators, possibly because Rory McEwen was facing away from the microphone when he introduced him and no one heard the name.
