# English shanties and song sung at sea

This series is dedicated to the captioned kind of music.

As this is an area that has decent ongoing research and public enthusiasm, there should be plenty of useful materials elsewhere online. Hence, entries are only made here if they provide something at least marginally special. Entries may include lyrics, additional explanatory notes, or sheet music transcriptions.

## Definitions

I think the term "shanty" should refer to a subset of songs sung by sailors at sea (alliteration almost intended) in the sense that shanties strictly refer to work songs. That is, they are sung to coordinate movement and boost morale *while carrying out hard work* [1]; whereas songs that don't comply by these can be seen as folk songs about seafaring in general. Thus, the following comparison table for quick differentiation between the two kinds can be established:

|  | Shanties | Other sea songs |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Involves ideas about seafaring | Of course | Of course |
| Call-and-response format | Yes | No |
| Verse length | Shorter | Longer |
| Accompaniment texture | Thinner, can be none | Thicker |

These are based on my personal observations through my extremely limited listening. Take with a grain of salt (preferably sea salt).

Nonetheless, in our settings on land, when we're singing these songs for our enjoyment, things can still go quite swimmingly even if you have to sing the call-and-response all by yourself with a guitar in your hand to back you up.

## Songs

> **Aside:**
> I left out a couple songs such as Ewan MacColl's [*The Shoals of Herring* (Roud 13642)](https://mainlynorfolk.info/ewan.maccoll/songs/theshoalsofherring.html) because they are too new and are in copyrighted circulation. Look them up elsewhere online.

### The Leaving of Liverpool

Roud 9435 [2].

##### Lyrics

The following is the lyrical transcription of the version sung by Rory McEwen, Martin Carthy, Paul McNeill [a], and Bob Davenport on 1963-12-07 on the TV programme *Hullabaloo* [2], presented by Rory McEwen. [3]

> (ALL)  
> Farewell to dear old Liverpool,  
> River Mersey, fare thee well.  
> I'm bound to California [n1],  
> A place that I know well.  
>
> (Refrain, ALL)  
> So fare thee well, my own true love,  
> When I return, united we will be.  
> It's not the leaving of Liverpool that grieves me,  
> But my darling, when I think on thee.  
>
> (Carthy)  
> I am bound for California,  
> By way of the stormy Cape Horn.  
> And I'll write to you a letter, love,  
> When I am homeward bound.  
>
> (Refrain)  
>
> (Davenport)  
> Well I've shipped aboard a Yankee clipper ship,  
> *Davy Crockett* is her name [n2].  
> And Burgess is the captain of her,  
> He's a sod, and the ship's the same.  
>
> (Refrain)  
>
> (McEwen)  
> It's the second time I've sailed with Burgess,  
> And I think I know him well.  
> If a man's a sailor, he can get along,  
> But if not, then he's sure in hell.  
>
> (Refrain)  
>
> (McNeill)  
> Farewell to dear old [Lime Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lime_Street,_Liverpool) [n3],   
> Anson Terrace, and Park Lane.  
> There's only one thing that grieves my mind,  
> I may never see you again.  
>
> (Refrain)

Remarks:
- [n1] The Dubliners' version sings this word with pronunciation /ˌkæ.lɪ.ˈfɔr.naɪ.e/ [4].
- [n2] Davenport's accent sings the *NAME* vowel as a long monophthong instead of a diphthong.
- [n3] Other versions may say "Lower Frederick Street" instead.

The song is about an Englishman leaving his lover to go to California, presumably during the times of the gold rush [2, 3]. There are alternative versions at [2, 4, 5, 6].

##### Music transcription

An alternative version is available at [6]. This is obviously done before, but I'm adding my two cents for [3].

##### Notes

- [a] [Paul McNeill](https://www.mainlynorfolk.info/folk/records/paulmcneill.html)'s name seems to be omitted often by commentators, possibly because the audience was clapping very loudly when Rory McEwen introduced him.
