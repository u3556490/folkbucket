# English shanties and song sung at sea

This series is dedicated to the captioned kind of music.

As this is an area that has decent ongoing research and public enthusiasm, there should be plenty of useful materials elsewhere online. Hence, entries are only made here if they provide something at least marginally special. Entries may include lyrics, additional explanatory notes, or sheet music transcriptions.

## Definitions

I think the term "shanty" should refer to a subset of songs sung by sailors at sea (alliteration almost intended) in the sense that shanties strictly refer to work songs. That is, they are sung to coordinate movement and boost morale *while performing physical labour* [1]; whereas songs that don't comply by these can be seen as folk songs about seafaring in general. Thus, the following comparison table for quick differentiation between the two kinds can be established:

|  | Shanties | Other sea songs |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Involves ideas about seafaring | Of course | Of course |
| Call-and-response format | Yes | No |
| Verse length | Shorter | Longer |
| Accompaniment texture | Thinner, can be none | Thicker |

These are based on my personal observations through my extremely limited listening. Take with a grain of salt (preferably sea salt).

Nonetheless, in our settings on land, when we're singing these songs for our enjoyment, things can still go quite swimmingly even if you have to sing the call-and-response all by yourself with a guitar in your hand to back you up.

## Songs

> **Aside:**  
> I left out a couple songs such as Ewan MacColl's [*The Shoals of Herring* (Roud 13642)](https://mainlynorfolk.info/ewan.maccoll/songs/theshoalsofherring.html) because they are too new and are in copyrighted circulation. Look them up elsewhere online.

### Jack Tar on Shore

Roud 919 [7], alt. titles: *Jack Tar* [9], *Jack's Disaster* [11]. Despite the title, this should not be confused with Roud 511 which can be called *Jacky Tar* or *Jack the Jolly Tar* [8].

##### Lyrics

Ewan MacColl acquired the song from traditional singer Harry Cox of Norfolk [7], but on the 1957 album *Blow Boys Blow* (which he recorded with A. L. Lloyd) [9] a slightly different set of words is sung. They are:

> So come all you ladies gay who delights in sailors' joy  
> Listen while I sing to you a song:  
> When Jack Tar [n1] he comes ashore with his gold and silvery store  
> There's no one can get rid of it so soon  
> 
> The first thing Jack require was a fiddler to his hand  
> Likewise the best liquor of every kind  
> And a pretty girl likewise with two dark and rolling eyes  
> And Jack he is suited to his mind  
> 
> The landlady she comes in dressed all in her Sunday [n2] best  
> She looks like some bright and morning star  
> She's ready to wait on him when she finds he's plenty of tin  
> Chalk him down to the one behind the bar  
> 
> His wages was soon gone and his friends they were all flown  
> And the flash girls they departed for another  
> And the landlady she cried, "Pay your score and get outside,  
> Your cargo's gone and you've hit [n3] stormy weather!"  
> 
> Now Jack all in his rage, he threw bottles at her head  
> And likewise all the glasses he let fly  
> And the poor girl in a fright called the watchman of the night  
> Saying, "Take this young lader [n4] lad away!"  
> 
> Now Jack did understand that a ship lay wanting hands  
> And to her he went straight down  
> With a sweet and pleasant gale he unfurled his lofty sail   
> Adieu to the flash girls of the town  
> 
> So he laid her on a tack like a cutter or a smack  
> As she rolled from the lee to the weather  
> And he kept her full and by [n5] close to wind as she would lie  
> We were bound for Blackwall [n6] in stormy weather  

Notes:  
- [n0] This is modified from [10], which is very similar.
- [n1] "Jack Tar" is a common term to refer to sailors. "Jack" being a random dude's name, and "tar" either refers to teh material used to make clothing waterproof or the waterproof garment known as "tarpaulins". [14]
- [n2] Read /ˈsʌndi/.
- [n3] Could be "met".
- [n4] Couldn't hear clearly. Most likely "lader" (someone who loads cargo onto a vessel [15]).
- [n5] Not sure what this is, sounds like "eye".
- [n6] This place can be the Blackwall Rock [13] in East London.

In terms of metre, this song is rather fluid. The 1st and 3rd lines can be analysed as 6-7 feet in groups of 3+3 or 4+3, and the other two 4-5 feet.

When compared to Harry Cox's original version (text available at [7, 11]), Ewan MacColl included an extra verse that better explained why Jack went back to his ship after the fiasco at the bar. The song feels less well-attested (judging by the length of the article at [7]).

##### Music transcription

I am inclined to consider Ewan MacColl's lively arrangement the better way to perform the song. Its melody basically looks like this:

![image](./music/Jack%20Tar%20(Ewan%20MacColl).png)

Remarks for Ewan MacColl's version:  
- Funny enough his tempo is about the double of the original (see below).
- Another important observation is how significantly this deviates from what Harry Cox would have delivered, both in melody and harmony.
- It's an upper mordent on the syllable *shore* (mm. 6) but the ornament is a `C-E-C`. The grace note on *gold* is... very optional.
- The melody in measure 8 contains a tritone run. Though it is anchored on the G on the downbeat and not too hard to perform, it threw me off when I was trying to figure out the mode (and thus, the harmony) of the song when I tried to learn to sing it.

For comparison, Harry Cox's original [12] looks like this:

![image](./music/Jack%20Tar%20on%20Shore%20(Harry%20Cox%20ver.).png)

Depending on what you like you can perform whichever one, or a blend of the two.

Remarks for Harry Cox's version:  
- Do remember each verse deviates from this a little bit. To fully learn Harry Cox's version, learn via the recording.
- I took the liberty to transcribe some of the grace notes, but they aren't really important - only the one on the word *gay* is relevant.
- Except the anticipation and rhythmic embellishments, this is also the simple skeleton melody.
- The chords on measures 5-6 are uncertain. An alternative is to use something like `V I | I IV` or `V I | iii IV`
- The harmony of measure 2 is chosen to be `vi` instead of `IV` because I feel it to be a continuation of a tonic function. You can do what you want though.
- The closing gesture in the latter half of mm. 7 is reminiscent of classic contrapuntal techniques. It is a derivation of a 2nd species counterpoint line against a bass in 5-1 motion: First you fill in the top line with B and F#, then turn the two notes into triplets, each decorated with an upper neighbour, before the notes in the middle are removed to give two seemingly disjoint non-chord tones in C# -> G#.

> **Aside:** Transcription pitfalls  
> Two things:
> 1. When transcribing Harry Cox's version, I spent unnecessary time adding extra beats to 4/4 measures, before realising I failed to put the right pickup beat. This was discovered when the harmonic rhythm seemed too unusual. Given Ewan MacColl's version I could have totally observed the rhythmic features there first; also the metre of the words provide crucial hints. Luckily shifting the time signatures and stuff around was not too hard, until...
> 2. Musescore 4 crashed on me just before I finished up fine-tuning the transcription. I should have saved often but this doesn't change the fact that it would still crash. I reckon the constant experimentations with time signatures and irregular measures (making the pickup by deleting 3 beats from a 4/4 measure) might make it unstable.  
>   2.1 Nevermind, it crashed again just now when I'm not doing anything silly. Maybe I should fall back to Musescore 3 and see what happens.
>
> The smart ones among you should also notice how the measure numbers can be inaccurate (the pickup should not be counted), but please ignore it - it is very obvious why it happens.

### The Leaving of Liverpool

Roud 9435 [2].

##### Lyrics

The following is the lyrical transcription of the version sung by Rory McEwen, Martin Carthy, Paul McNeill [a], and Bob Davenport on 1963-12-07 on the TV programme *Hullabaloo* [2], presented by Rory McEwen. [3]

> (ALL)  
> Farewell to dear old Liverpool,  
> River Mersey, fare thee well.  
> I'm bound to California [n1],  
> A place that I know well.  
>
> (Refrain, ALL)  
> So fare thee well, my own true love,  
> When I return, united we will be.  
> It's not the leaving of Liverpool that grieves me,  
> But my darling, when I think on thee.  
>
> (Carthy)  
> I am bound for California,  
> By way of the stormy Cape Horn.  
> And I'll write to you a letter, love,  
> When I am homeward bound.  
>
> (Refrain)  
>
> (Davenport)  
> Well I've shipped aboard a Yankee clipper ship,  
> *Davy Crockett* is her name [n2].  
> And Burgess is the captain of her,  
> He's a sod, and the ship's the same.  
>
> (Refrain)  
>
> (McEwen)  
> It's the second time I've sailed with Burgess,  
> And I think I know him well.  
> If a man's a sailor, he can get along,  
> But if not, then he's sure in hell.  
>
> (Refrain)  
>
> (McNeill)  
> Farewell to dear old [Lime Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lime_Street,_Liverpool) [n3],   
> Anson Terrace, and Park Lane.  
> There's only one thing that grieves my mind,  
> I may never see you again.  
>
> (Refrain)

Remarks:
- [n1] The Dubliners' version sings this word with pronunciation /ˌkæ.lɪ.ˈfɔr.naɪ.e/ [4].
- [n2] Davenport's accent sings the *NAME* vowel as a long monophthong instead of a diphthong.
- [n3] Other versions may say "Lower Frederick Street" instead.

The song is about an Englishman leaving his lover to go to California, presumably during the times of the gold rush [2, 3]. There are alternative versions at [2, 4, 5, 6]. The metre of the verse *very* loosely falls into a ballad metre.

##### Music transcription

An alternative version is available at [6]. This is obviously done before, but I'm adding my two cents for [3].

![image](./music/The%20Leaving%20of%20Liverpool.png)

The different versions of the song are arguably very similar, and if you superimpose them on top of one another, it is quite likely that you can get a nice heterophonic effect.

##### Notes

- [a] [Paul McNeill](https://www.mainlynorfolk.info/folk/records/paulmcneill.html)'s name seems to be omitted often by commentators, possibly because Rory McEwen was facing away from the microphone when he introduced him and no one heard the name.
