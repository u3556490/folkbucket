## Purpose

This repository is a collection of study notes I made on various subjects on world music, (traditional and contemporary) folk music and other things that I happen to like. Obviously, quality is not guaranteed, and this should be considered oversimplified opinions laced with tinges of truth.

These notes serve the purpose(s) of:

- Continuing the heritage carried by the arts, lest they go extinct.
  
- Ok that was your fancy hypocritical reason. My reason is to make sure I don't forget as much when I want to use ideas from these forms of music in my own compositions - the true motivation is thoroughly self-benefit. Whether the world happens to benefit from it is a side effect.

As such, the texts are not guaranteed to be of superior quality or comprehensive with details. As long as they can act as an effective pointer into an obscure unreleased page of my memory, they serve their purpose well.

## Copyright

### Principle: Traditional music should be in the public domain

The author(s) are opined that traditional folk music and world music, including at least the performing art and the repertoire, deserve to rightly reside in the public domain. There should be no "trade secrets" and deliberate obstacles that hinder new learners from possibly mastering the art(s) in any way.

Nonetheless, in all fairness, individual performances and renditions may be protected by copyright due to their individual performers. Likewise, considering the idea vs expression divide, the author(s) steadfastly believe that ideas are free. In addition thereto, if an idea is only found to be documented in one place (having only one expression), then the expression should be free in the public domain as well, to not erect an unnecessary and unwanted barrier between mankind and knowledge.

In short, traditional music should be kept in the public domain, cleanly clear of influences by the hands of copyright.

The author(s), in the aforementioned spirit, will release this body of work in the public domain as much as possible (see section below), and pledge to prevent plagiarism: No directly copying or violation of copyright, especially when held rightfully and pertaining to a specific rendition; and with immeasurable reluctance, respect the reprehensible wankstains who do put relevant educational materials behind a superfluous wall of copyright, up to wherever the applicable laws may permit in terms of fair use, educational use, or not-for-profit use.

## Citations

The principle of citations is _"Include for good measure, but don't waste too much time."_

In the spirit of the 2nd point in [Purpose](#purpose) and the [Copyright principles](#principle-traditional-music-should-be-in-the-public-domain), references are supposed to be included to:

- Provide extra context and pointers for more knowledge
- Avoid allegations of plagiarism

The references are not used for:

- Preventing link rot: We are not an archive
- Make sure every sentence is traceable: We are not Wikipedia; read the 1st paragraph under [Purpose](#purpose) again

There is not much of a standard citation style to speak of, but recommended guidelines are available [here](./citations.md), on which I did waste too muh time.
