# Binnorie
Roud 8, Child 10 [1, child-list]. Other title(s): The Twa Sisters, The Two Sisters [1], The Cruel Sister [9], Binnorie O Binnorie [3]

The following uses Rory and Alex McEwen's performance on the 1956 album *Great Scottish Ballads* as the main reference [2].

## Lyrics

Being one of the oldest Scottish ballads [3] and one of the usual ones about murder [4], this one has many versions, which, welp, goes without saying. The version sung in [2] is almost identical to the version by John Strachan as transcribed in [1, 3]:

> There were twa [n1] sisters lived in a glen,  
> Binnorie, o Binnorie, (*this line is always the second line, and will be omitted unless it's different*)  
> And the bonnie millart [n2] laddie cam a-coortin' [n3] o them,  
> By the bonnie mill dams o' Binnorie.  
> 
> Oh sister, oh sister, will ye take a walk  
> Roond [n4] by the dams o' Binnorie,  
> For tae hear the blackbird whistle o'er his notes  
> By the bonnie mill dams o' Binnorie.  
> 
> O they walked up and sae did they doon   
> Till the elder stepped aside and dang [n5] the younger in  
> Till the deep mill dams o' Binnorie.  
> 
> Oh sister, oh sister, stretch oot your hand,  
> And I'll gie ye my gold and a fift o' my land [n6]  
> For the bonnie millart laddie o' Binnorie.  
> 
> It wisna [n7] for your money that I dang you in,  
> It's ye being sae fair, love, and I sae very grim [n8]  
> For the bonnie millart laddie o' Binnorie.  
> 
> Oh millart, oh millart, rin [n9] oot your dam  
> For there's some grand lady or some deid [n10] swan  
> Floatin' up and doon the water o' Binnorie.  

Notes (all from [scots-dict] unless otherwise specified):  
- [n1] two
- [n2] miller; oftentimes the singers sing "miller" outright
- [n3] *coort* = English "court", here means "to woo"
- [n4] clipping of *aroond* ("around")
- [n5] past tense of *ding* ("to push") [1, scots-dict]
- [n6] *gie* = give, *fift* = fifth
- [n7] was not
- [n8] grey, dusky [scots-dict]; figuratively "ugly" [1]
- [n9] run [scots-dict], here means "to let the water run out of the dam"?
- [n10] dead

More variants available at [1, 5, 6, 7]. [5] alone cites 25 variants, and [7] says there are 24, some others say more than 90 [8] or outright 500 [9]. The earliest reference to this ballad was in 1656 [3] and the concept of "woman murders sister out of jealousy" is apparently widespread across European folk music traditions [4].

The metre is not strict but roughly fits into a ballad metre - if this archetype isn't overly applied already - by counting how syllables align with the musical downbeats. The lack of strict metric feet pervading the piece can be attributed to the long history of the song; in a sense, it is the fluidity that makes it natural, unlike a carefully concocted poem that fits a specific melody.

Notes:  
- [n 1] As I always say the singers were not of a strongly rhotic accent. Some words do not follow dictionary pronunciations either.
- [n 2] I have a feeling I have been transcribing too many geminated consonants (*laddie* would have been /læddi/), especially nasals, but the word *bonnie* does seem to contain a geminated /n/.
- [n 3] The second vowel is a bit unclear, it is more open than a schwa. May be a /ɑ/.
- [n 4] Not the /baɪ/ as expected, but rhymes with the vowel of *dams*.
- [n 5] It's more fronted and rounded than the transcribed diphthong, but I'm not gonna bother.
- [n 6] The vowel of *young* is almost identical to a schwa.
- [n 7] The gemination's different this time.
- [n 8] Reduced the vowel to schwa in the word before.
- [n 9] Slightly like *dang ye*, with a sandhi linking between the syllables; yet it is rather faint.
- [n 10] The geminated /l/ in *millart* can be realised as a long /l/.
- [n 11] There is some degree of yod-coalescence.

## Musical transcription

I am obscenely lazy so I will assume the version sung by the McEwens has never been transcribed. Nonetheless you may find alternative versions to the song transcribed at [11, 12].

Notes:  
- The crecendo to forte is especially marked in verse 3. Considering how it is often a line that brings out contrastive plot, I think the `vi` chord for mm. 6 is well justified.
- The chords were roughly identified from the recording [2].

Notably the version sung by John Strachan, despite sharing the lyrics, has a rather different melody [10]. I decided to spend a bit of time to transcribe it.

Notes:  
- Cut time is used because I think it allows for better clarity in the transcription. The measure numbers are off because this version followed the other one [in the PDF](./music/Binnorie.pdf).
- The grace notes are optional in performance. The dotted notes (3 occurrences) are also optional, and only indicate one of the notes is longer than the other - use some swing, a 2:1 ratio is just about somewhat inaccurate.
- The harmony is approximate, don't really take mine for it.
