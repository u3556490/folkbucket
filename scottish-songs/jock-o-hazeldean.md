# Jock O'Hazeldean
Roud 250, Child 293 [1, child-list]. Other title(s): John of Hazelgreen [1]

The following uses Rory and Alex McEwen's performance on the 1957 album *Scottish Songs and Ballads* [2] as the main reference.

## Words

The song was collected and edited by Sir Walter Scott [1] though the first verse is said to be much older [3]. From his lyrics [3], the version sung by the McEwens can be transcribed as follows:

> "Why weep ye by the tide, ladie?  
> Why weep ye by the tide?  
> I'll wed ye tae [n0] my youngest son,  
> And you sall [n1] be his bride:  
> And you sall be his bride, ladie,  
> Sae comely [n2] tae be seen!"  
> But aye she loot the tears down fa' [n3]  
> For Jock [n4] o' Hazeldean.  
> 
> "Now let this wilful [n5] grief be done,  
> And dry that cheek so pale;  
> Young Frank is chief o' Errington,  
> And lord o' Langley-dale;  
> His step is first in peaceful ha' [n6],  
> His sword in battle keen!"  
> But aye she loot the tear down fa'  
> For Jock o' Hazeldean.  
> 
> "A chain o' gold ye sall not lack,  
> Nor braid to bind your hair;  
> Nor mettled [n7] hound, nor managed hawk,  
> Nor palfrey [n8] fresh and fair;  
> And ye, the foremost o' them a' [n9],  
> Shall ride our forest queen!"  
> But aye she loot the tear down fa'  
> For Jock o' Hazeldean.  
> 
> The kirk was deck'd at morning-tide [n10],  
> The taper glimmer'd fair;  
> The priest and bridegroom wait the bride,  
> The dame and knight are there.  
> They sought her baith by bower and ha' [n11];  
> The ladie was not seen!  
> She's o'er the Border and awa' [n12]  
> Wi [n13] Jock o' Hazeldean.

The song is about a lady eloping with her true love to avoid an arranged marriage [3]. Once again the song uses ballad metre and you could sing this to House of the Rising Sun if you will; the song can be alternatively analysed to be written in fourteeners (each line having 14 syllables, or if you squint hard enough, two ballad metre lines joined together).

Other versions of the lyrics can be found from [4, 5].

Notes:  
- [n 1]: Almost /je/ to my ears but I know it isn't supposed to be like that.
- [n 2]: The quality of the two *a*'s are different. The first one is like [[æ]] but more retracted and closed; the second is not as open as a real [[æ]] and still sounds a bit reduced, hence a schwa.
- [n 3]: The /iːn/ sound almost like /ʲiːŋ/ to me, with the word *keen* being the most obvious. Also note that the vowel in *be* is pronounced inconsistently.
- [n 4]: The *pale* vowel is a diphthong as in RP but almost sounds like /eː/ to me.
- [n 5]: The *ir* in *first* is not pronounced with a rhotic accent, and the *-ful* suffix has a different pronunciation compared to *wilful*.
- [n 6]: The pronunciation of *fa'* has changed compared to previous verse to fit the rhyme. (?)
- [n 7]: Essentially *shall no lack*.
- [n 8]: The vowel in *your* is reduced but probably not as much so as an actual schwa; and the *hair* vowel is slightly more open than /ɛ/. Note *to* is pronounced with a reduced vowel instead of /te/.
- [n 9]: I don't specifically mark where the affricates are but I must do so here to avoid confusion.
- [n 10]: There is a change of singer and here the singer uses trills /r/ more often.
- [n 11]: The *-ning* in *morning* sounded like /neŋ/.
- [n 12]: The non-rhotacism strikes again.
- [n 13]: Someone was trying to sing *search* instead of *sought* on the recording.

Once again the singers showed an unexpectedly light accent - very notable in the non-rhotic pronunciation of *first* - but the Scottish-ness is still there nonetheless.
