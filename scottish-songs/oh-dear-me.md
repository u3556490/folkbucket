# Oh Dear Me (The Jute Mill Song)
Roud 2585. Other title: The Jute Mill Song [1]

Words by Mary Brooksbank, music by Ewan MacColl [1].

> This song is first recorded in 1958 and is by no means traditional; it is better included in some industrial revolution-themed folk song collection instead. It is included here for the time being because it *is* a folk song (happens to have a Roud number despite being contemporary) of Scotland.
>
> Another reason why this is accepted is because of a conflict of interest: The author might perform this in a few days and needs good reference.

The following uses Ewan MacColl's performance collected in the anthology album *An Introduction to Ewan MacColl* as the main reference [2]. The recording is likely taken from the 1958 album *Second Shift* with Peggy Seeger in accompaniment [1, 3].

## Words

The words are widely available online but the following is the version sung in [2], edited to conform with orthography by [scots-dict].

> Oh dear me, the mill's gaein fest [n1],  
> The puir [n2] wee shifters canna [n3] get a rest.  
> Shiftin' bobbins, coorse [n4] and fine,  
> They fairly mak ye wirk [n5] for yer ten and nine.  
>
> Oh dear me, I [n6] wish the day wis [n7] done,  
> Rinnin' up and doon the pass is nae fun. [n8]  
> Shiftin', piecin', spinnin', warp, weft, and twine,  
> Tae feed and cled my bairnie affen ten and nine. [n9]  
>
> Oh dear me, the warld's [n10] ill-divided,  
> Them that wirk the hardest are the least provided.  
> I maun [n11] bide contented, dark days or fine,  
> But there's no [n12] much pleasure livin' affen ten and nine.  

Notes:
- [n1] going fast [scots-dict], otherwise spelled *gaun fast*
- [n2] poor [scots-dict], otherwise spelled *pair*
- [n3] cannot [scots-dict], equivalent to *can* + *nae*
- [n4] coarse [1]
- [n5] make you work [1, scots-dict]
- [n6] some spell it *a*, phonetically
- [n7] was [scots-dict]
- [n8] "running up and down the pass is not fun"; some transcribe *pass* as *path*
- [n9] "to feed and dress by child out of ten shillings and ninepence" [1, scots-dict]
- [n10] world's [scots-dict]
- [n11] must [scots-dict]
- [n12] could be *nae* for "not"

A very simple song about the hard work and low pay of mill workers of the early 20th century in Dundee [1]. The 1st verse is meant to be a refrain [4], and Brooksbank noted that the music should be much older than when she had written it down [4]. More information about Brooksbank at [5].

In terms of metre, the verses like to start each line on a strong beat and follow with iambs through, without adhering to common metrical patterns like ballad or common metres.

I saw some commenter saying Ewan MacColl sang in Doric Scots, but having checked the Wikipedia page [6] highlighting the accentual differences, I reckon it is not particularly true.

Notes:
- [n 1] Not sure about the exact pronunciation of *gaein*
- [n 2] Should be /peɾ/ according to [scots-dict]
- [n 3] *Nine* and *fine* should be of the same vowel category but are not sung to perfectly rhyme
- [n 4] The vowel was more open and (perhaps) more backwards, maybe more like /ə/ or even /ɒ/
- [n 5] The pronunciation of *world* is kinda like /ˈwə.ɾəl/, but the latter syllable must be very close to a syllabic /l/, whereas the former is like a somewhat more open and fronted schwa, but not as much as /a/ (the pronunciation [scots-dict] would give).
- [n 6] I suppose you should be aware that /a/s are more like /ɑ/, not necessarily that fronted
- [n 7] This was very much like /ʌ/

## Sheet music transcription

[2] transcribes out to be:

This is obviously done before [7], even complete with 3 verses [8]. The chords can be found online as well [9], though I suppose I want to figure out my own.

Remarks:
- The 1st verse is slightly different, which is understandable - it was meant to be a chorus.
- When compared to [9] there are places where the use of `IV` chord are different. This is because the notes being accentuated do not seem to conform to the proposed harmony.
- Likewise, the penultimate chord to each verse should be `ii` instead of `vi` to get more "movement" from stable harmonic functions. But you do you.
