# Analysis of Folk Tunes

This is an abridged summary of [Folkopedia's](https://folkopedia.info/wiki/Main_Page) pages on analysing folk tunes from the British Isles and the Anglophone world [1, 2]. The author finds some concepts (and new jargon) interesting and worthy of note, and thus this document is written as some simple digest.

Anyways.

## Elements to analyse

The following are listed in [1] as aspects of the tunes that should be analysed:

- **Metre or time signature**. The author believes that this also has something to do with the poetic metre as well.
- **Determine the type of the scale**. This is where the new jargon comes in, see next section.
- **Melodic range or "compass"**. Compass or range both refer to the distance between the highest and lowest notes of the melody.
- **Finalise the scale**, that is, to ascertain which exact scale it is, and to assign a key signature to it.
- **Investigate the significance of accidentals**, in case you found the wrong scale.

The folk songs included in this repository are typically not analysed to this level as it is deemed unnecessary. It must be noted that such analysis is useful for comparisons between melodies [1].

## Scales

This is why the author chose to write this set of notes (no pun intended).

Terminologies:

### Keynote

> This is *the (pitch of the) final note of the song* [2].

The author presumes that this note is very important to determining the tonal centre of the melody as it provides a resting anchor for the melody to terminate on, hence the possibly confusing nomenclature (depending on how you think about it, this may not determine the *key*).

### Authentic vs Plagal scales

> If the keynote is the lowest / highest note of the scale, then the scale is authentic, else the scale is plagal [2].

The author thinks authentic scales mean "the keynote actually indicates the tonal centre or the *tonic*, *the 1st scale degree* so to say, and as such, trivially identifies the key if it is defined".

The definition also implies that authenticity, in principle, has nothing to do with the *mode* that the scale pertains to (if applicable). The apparent mode is identified by the feel and harmony (sometimes only implied) of the song, and may not always manifest as scale degrees omitted or modified with accidentals (when analysed as the wrong mode, e.g. 6th scale degree being raised in Aeolian means it should be somehow Dorian). However, by not ending on the 1st scale degree, the melody *weakens* the sense of the mode / scale it apparently is in.

### Full and gapped scales

> **Aside:** The author opts to omit the points about major and minor scales and that about the decline of traditional modal scales [2].

> A full scale is heptatonic, and a gapped scale has fewer notes than that. [2]

Another way to phrase this is to say "A full scale is heptatonic - always a mode of the natural major (or far less commonly in this context, a mode of harmonic or melodic minor) scale - whereas a gapped scale has fewer notes than seven."

As mentioned before, gapped scales may create ambiguity between modes, and can be used to evoke a sense of a certain mode without touching its most distinctive scale degree(s).

Examples of interesting full and gapped scales are listed in [2].

### Hemitonic and anhemitonic scales

> If a scale contains a half-step between two consecutive scale degrees, it is hemitonic, else anhemitonic. [2]

This is some jargon trivia.

### Case study

At the moment of writing (2025-06-30), among the folk songs included in this repository, only [*Oh Dear Me*](../scottish-songs/oh-dear-me.md) is plagal. If we analyse it as Eb Ionian, it highlights the 5th scale degree - which is the keynote - and as such has a strongly Mixolydian feel.

The melody is missing the 7th scale degree (gapped scale!), which can be interpreted as a move to indicate a Mixolydian tendency as well. However, the author hears and subjectively feels that the character of the harmony is not supportive of a Mixolydian interpretation, because the Ab chord and Bb note take on major scale harmonic functions rather well. Thus the song is not analysed as such; though wiggle room about whether there is a modal interchange / modulation can be present.

Needless to say, with the half-step between the 3rd and 4th scale degrees (G -> Ab), the scale is hemitonic. While we're at it, we can also tell that the melody's compass is a compound perfect fourth.
