# Willie's Fair
Roud 206 [1], Child 215 [1, child-list]. Other title(s): Rare Willie's Drowned in Yarrow [1], The Water o' Garmie [2], etc.

The following uses Rory and Alex McEwen's 1956 performance on the album *Great Scottish Ballads* [3] as the main reference. Go to Mainly Norfolk [1] for further reading.

## Words
The version by Patsy Seddon [1] has lyrics most similar to the version sung by the McEwens. From there, the words are worked out to be:

> Willie's rare and Willie's fair  
> And Willie's wondrous bonnie [n1],  
> And Willie's hecht [n2] tae [n3] marry me  
> Gin e'er he marries ony [n4].  
> 
> Yestreen I mad' my bed fu' braid [n5],  
> The nicht [n6] I'll mak it narrow,  
> For a' the lee lang [n7] winter's nicht  
> I'll lie twined o' my marrow [n8].  
> 
> O cam ye by yon waterside,  
> Pu'd [n9] you the rose or lily  
> Or cam ye by yon meadow green  
> Or saw ye my sweet Willie?  
> 
> She socht [n10] him high [n11], she socht him lay [n11],  
> She socht him braid and narrow,  
> Syne [n12] in the cliftin' o' a crag [n13]  
> She's found him drooned [n14] in Yarrow.  
> 
> She's found him drooned in Yarrow.

Explanations for those who only know antipodean English:  
- [n1] handsome, beautiful
- [n2] vowed [1], pledged
- [n3] to
- [n4] whole line: If [4] ever he marries any
- [n5] whole line: Last night (*yester-* + *even[[ing]]*) I made my bed full broad [1]
- [n6] night
- [n7] lifelong [1]
- [n8] *twined* means "separated" [1], *marrow* in the sense of "essence"
- [n9] pulled
- [n10] sought, searched [[for]]
- [n11] the Scots words for "high" and "low" are *heich* and *laich* respectively, but I didn't particularly hear them
- [n12] there, thereupon [8]; the word is found from [9]
- [n13] *crag* means cleft of a rock [1]
- [n14] drowned

This is a song about the loss of a lover, who is found to have drowned in a river [1]. The term *Yarrow* refers to a river that is a tributary of river Tweed [7].

As with many folk ballads, it uses the common metre (alternating iambic tetrametre and iambic trimetre, four lines make a stanza), more specifically a "ballad metre", where the choice of each foot is more flexible [5, 6]. This song uses trochees in place of iambs in the several verses. As a consequence, the melody of this song is *almost* interchangeable with every ballad in the common metre, the smaller lyrical differences and one's lack of imaginations being the only obstacles.

*The Book of Scottish Song* of 1843 [10] is the earliest attestation I can find (on the first page of Google), the song is obviously older than that. Alternative* versions of the song text can be found from [1, 2, 7, 9, 10] and other sources.

Remarks:
- [n 1] The quality of the two vowels in *wondrous* may be identical, initially they sound the same to me. The second one, in particular, is eventually transcribed to a schwa instead.
- [n 2] While vowel length is uncertain, it is very clear by this point that /æ/'s are not present in the singers' accent, and they sound the same as /a/.
- [n 3] The pronunciations of *gin* and *e'er* are quite unexpected. The tapped /r/ in *e'er* almost had a velar/uvular nature. Another curiosum is the *-ie* or *-y* in the different forms of *marry*, between two consecutive lines the vowel quality seems to have changed.
- [n 4] Two key features to look at: Firstly, the *r* in *winter* is not tapped, and is dropped much like RP. Secondly, the *-s* of *'s* is voiced by one singer only, so I marked it with a "voiceless /z/".
- [n 5] The quality of the /ʌ/ in *kam* differs from the previous ones, it's closer to /a/. The *i* diphthong in *waterside* is a bit like /ɐɪ/ but not that open.
- [n 6] Can't hear the end of the line very clearly.
- [n 7] The pronunciation of *braid* has changed.

I have an impression that the McEwens sang in a mild Scots accent (can't be sure where to draw the line between Scots and Scottish English), because they wanted to appeal to a wider audience. This transcription is very rough though, vowel lengths and qualities are uncertain. Raise an issue if you have better ideas.

## Sheet music transcription

![image](./music/Willie's%20Fair.png)

It was not particularly easy to transcribe because the performers used their discretion in the rhythms quite a lot.

> **Aside:**
>
> I learned the song by ear and then did the transcription. It is indeed somewhat easier this way, I could strum a guitar while I count the beats and plan out the harmony.
> 
> In terms of harmony, the final stressed syllable should land on a IV chord (subdominant) instead of a I (tonic), not just because it's a 6th in the melody (the note is not highlighted anyway), but also because the music seemed to "end" on a sense of longing, a sense that there's more yet to come.
