# The Lowlands of Holland
Roud 484 [1].

The following uses Rory and Alex McEwen's performance on the 1957 album *Scottish Songs and Ballads* [2] as the main reference.

## Lyrics
The lyrics sung by the McEwen brothers are either directly taken from or happen to be very similar to a version in a 1776 book [1, 3]. The words are as follows (with English terms replaced with Scots ones):

> My love he built a bonny ship, and set her on the sea,  
> Wi' seven score guid mariners tae beir her company;  
> There's one score sunk, and two score drunk, and three score deid at sea,  
> And the laelands [n1] o' Holland hae twin'd my love and me.  
>
> My love then built another ship, and set her on the main,  
> Wi' nane [n2] but twenty mariners tae see her hame again.  
> But the weary wind began tae rise, and the sea began tae rout,  
> My love then and his bonny ship turn'd withershins [n3] about.  
>
> There shall ne'er [n4] coif [n5] come on my heid [n6], nor kaim [n7] come in my hair;  
> There shall ne'er coal nor candle licht come in my bower mair,  
> Nor will I love another man, until the day I die,  
> For I never lov'd a love but ane [n8], and he's droun'd in the sea.  
>
> O haud your wheesht [n9] my dochter dear, be still and be content,  
> There are mair lads in Galloway, ye need nae sair lament;  
> O there is nane in Galloway, there's nane at a' for me,  
> And the laelands o' Holland hae twin'd my love and me.  

Notes:  
- [n1] should be *laich* ("low") + *-land*, but pronounced without the *ch* sound.
- [n2] none [scots-dict]
- [n3] the wrong way around [scots-dict]
- [n4] should be *naither* ("neither") [scots-dict] but here without the consonant in between.
- [n5] hairdo [4]
- [n6] head [scots-dict]
- [n7] comb [scots-dict]
- [n8] pronounced like "yen", this means "one". [scots-dict]
- [n9] *haud yer wheesht* means "be quiet". [scots-dict]

Alternative versions are available all over the Internet, such as [1, 5, 6, 7, 8].

The typical interpretation of the song says it is about a woman singing the loss of her love, who was press-ganged into English naval service [1, 5] or otherwise went to war with the Dutch [9]. However, it must be noted that, from this particular set of words, one can only superficially deduce that the lost man being mourned had died at sea and nothing else.

The wordiness of the verses should not fool you into thinking "heh this time around it's not gonna be ballad metre right?". This song is written in fourteeners, i.e. each line has 14 syllables, specifically in the form of iambic heptameter. One can observe trivially that this is equivalent to two lines of ballad metre lyrics being merged as one. Therefore I might as well consider this a ballad as well.

Notes:
- [n 0] Many /ɾ/s behind vowels are hard to hear, and might not be present altogether
- [n 1] The /ʌ/ and /ɜ/ ar realised more like a schwa /ə/
- [n 2] And some /ɾ/s sound more vocalised to /ə/ than anything else
- [n 3] More like /jɛn/

## Music
Interestingly there aren't any transcriptions for the song within the first few pages of Google results, beside the chords given by [7]. As it turns out, the melody is somewhat similar to "When Johnny Comes Marching Home", a song from the opposite side of the Atlantic, but it's perhaps just me.

This one is relatively straightforward to transcribe, so no further notes.
