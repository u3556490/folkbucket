# Scottish folk ballads

Because I find it interesting and the lyrics hard to sing (I'm not Scottish) I figured I needed to make some notes while listening. So here they are.

## Contents

Currently we have the following tune(s):

| Title | Roud | Child |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Willie's Fair](./willies-fair.md) | 206 | 215 |

For each tune, lyrics (with rough phonetic transcription) and music transcription are provided. If there are more notes to make I would make them, but other than that you might find [Mainly Norfolk](https://mainlynorfolk.info) a very useful website for your needs.

The sheet music was made with MuseScore and the MIDI export may include chords, which you may feel free to ignore if not useful.

I take Rory and Alex McEwen's albums for reference at the moment and their versions are going to somewhat differ from the one(s) you heard.
