# The Dowie Dens o' Yarrow
Roud 13, Child 214 [1, child-list].

The following uses Rory and Alex McEwen's performance on the 1956 album *Great Scottish Ballads* as the main reference [2].

## Words
As always the version in the recording [2] is somewhat different from the others. The following is put together using Dick Gaughan's version in [1] and the text at [3] with a small hint from [4].

> Late at e'en [n1], drinkin' the wine,  
> And ere they paid the lawin, [n2]  
> They'd set a combat them between  
> Tae fecht it in the dawin. [n3]  
> 
> "O stay at hame, my noble lord!  
> O stay at hame, my marrow! [n4]  
> My cruel brother will you betray,  
> On the dowie [n5] dens o' Yarrow."  
>
> She's kissed his cheek, she's kaimed [n6] his hair,  
> As she had done before-o;  
> She's belted him wi' his noble brand,  
> And he's awa' tae Yarrow.  
>
> As he gaed [n7] doon the Tennies bank,  
> A wot [n8] he gaed wi' sorrow,  
> For, doon in a den, he spied nine armed men,  
> On the dowie dens o' Yarrow.  
>
> "O come ye here tae part your land,  
> Or come ye here tae borrow?  
> Or come ye here tae wield your brand,  
> On the dowie dens o' Yarrow?"  
>
> "I came not here tae part my land,  
> And ne'er tae beg nor borrow;  
> I came to wield my noble brand,  
> On the dowie dens o' Yarrow."  
>
> Four has he hurt, and five has slain,  
> On the bloody braes [n9] o' Yarrow,  
> Till that fause knight came him a-hint, [n10]   
> And ran his body thorough.  
>
> "O gentle wind, that bloweth south,  
> Frae where my love repaireth.  
> Convey a kiss frae his dear mouth.  
> And tell me how he fareth!"  
>
> As she gaed doon the Tennies bank,  
> A wot she gaed wi' sorrow,  
> For, doon in a den, she spied ten slain men,  
> On the bloody braes o' Yarrow. 

Notes:  
- [n1] evening
- [n2] "and before they paid the bill" [scots-dict]
- [n3] dawn, break of the day [scots-dict]
- [n4] *marrow* is a figurative way to say "dear"
- [n5] sad [scots-dict]
- [n6] combed [scots-dict]
- [n7] past tense of "go" (*gae*) [scots-dict]
- [n8] I know [scots-dict, 1]
- [n9] uplands [scots-dict]
- [n10] Until that false knight came [[at]] him from behind [scots-dict]

Other versions of the text are available at [1, 3, 4, 5, 6]. It should be noted that [3] is the same source as [7].

The song is a refreshment from the usual murder ballads in that this time it is mass murder. While other versions of the song suggest that the fight described is because of some grand lady having ten suitors, this version simply states that it comes out of some unknown dispute at a tavern. The reason why the brother betrays the male protagonist is not explained either (the other versions would do a better job at that).

Needless to say, this piece is in a ballad metre. Specifically, the most prominent metric foot is the iamb.

Notes:  
- [n 1] The *at* was pronounced in a more reduced manner.
- [n 2] The rhymes should end in -/n/ according to [scots-dict], but has a velar nasal sound to it in the recording.
- [n 3] The vowel is like /ɔ/ but more open, I was struggling to choose between /ɒ/ and /ʌ/.
- [n 4] Important that the word *cruel* is read as two syllables.
- [n 5] As with [n 1] there should be quite some reducing done in *as* and *had*.
- [n 6] Sometimes I think the stressed vowel in *borrow* or *sorrow* is /ɒ/ instead of /ɔ/, but I can't tell.
- [n 7] This does sit between /ɔ/ and a more fronted vowel like /a/.
- [n 8] Halfway between this /u/ and /e/, and rather unrounded, not like /ʉ/.
- [n 9] See the entry for *fower* on [scots-dict] for a better transcription.
- [n 10] Pronounced closer to /fuːs/ but obviously not that, so used a different transcription than [scots-dict].

## Sheet music transcription
One alternative version is available at [6], which, as the commentators correctly pointed out, is not a waltz. More versions can be found at [8, 9]. A fieldwork recording by Alan Lomax is available at the Lomax Digital Archive as well [10].

Remarks:  
- The original key was in B major and I transposed it to C major for simplicity.
- There may have been a chord change halfway through mm. 5 on the record, but I can't make much of it.
- The 1st verse starts with a stressed syllable on a downbeat, so a generic melody more representative of the other verses is included.
