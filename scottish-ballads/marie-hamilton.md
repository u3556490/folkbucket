# Marie Hamilton
Roud 79, Child 173 [1, child-list]. Other titles: Mary Hamilton, The Four Marys [1]

The following uses Rory and Alex McEwen's performance on the 1956 album *Great Scottish Ballads* [2] as the main reference, instead of the perhaps more popular Joan Baez one.

## Words
The version sung by the McEwen brothers is particularly hard to find, in the sense that there isn't a source (on the first page of Google results at least) that provide a near-perfect match, as compared to the other ballads transcribed so far. Nonetheless Gill Bowman's version [1] is a great starting point.

> Yestreen the Queen had four Maries,  
> The nicht she'll hae but three.  
> There was Marie Seton, and Marie Beaton,  
> And Marie Carmichael and me.  
>
> Oh often hae I dressed my Queen,  
> And put gold in her hair.  
> And now I've gotten for my reward,   
> The gallows tae be my share.  
>
> Oh often hae I dressed my Queen,  
> And often made her bed.  
> And now I've gotten for my reward,   
> The gallows tree for tae tread.  
>
> I charge [n 1] ye a', ye mariners,  
> When ye sail o'er the faem [n 2],  
> Let neither my faither nor mither get wit [n 3]  
> But that I'm coming hame [n 4].  
>
> Oh little did my mither ken [n 5]  
> When first she cradled me,  
> The lands I was tae travel in,  
> The death I was tae die.  
>
> (repeat 1st verse)
> Yestreen the Queen had four Maries,  
> The nicht she'll hae but three.  
> There was Marie Seton, and Marie Beaton,  
> Marie Carmichael and me.  

Notes:
- [n 1] assign a task or a duty [4]
- [n 2] foam, figuratively the sea [scots-dict]
- [n 3] knowledge, information; can also be *wat* (to know) [scots-dict]
- [n 4] home [scots-dict]
- [n 5] know [scots-dict], an obvious cognate of German *kennen*

Some transcription help is taken from the lyric version at [3]. Some Scottish / Scots vocabulary explained elsewhere I figured I would skip their explanations. I took the liberty to restructure the lines not in fourteeners but in ballad metre format (oh another one), on the grounds that the singers chose to resing the first couplet (or in this layout, the first verse) and it would make more sense if those lines were a verse of their own.

This song is about a courtier meeting a bad end. Specifically, the version sung here is a mixture of two legends: For one, the eponymous protagonist being a member of the court of Queen Mary of Scotland; and for the other, the protagonist being an expatriate as an attendant to a Russian monarch [5]. The reason behind the capital punishment is not explained. Well, either way, Marie dies.

More versions of the lyrics can be found at [1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8] and many more webpages elsewhere.

Notes:
- [n1] I'm a bit surprised to see how the distinction between *marry* and *Mary* turns out to be like this (compare [Willie's Fair](./willies-fair.md)); but the first *Marie*'s pronunciation changed to /ɪ/ in the final verse (repeat of the 1st verse, that is). Also a bit interesting is how *four* is not read *fower* as two distinct syllables.
- [n2] According to [scots-dict] the pronunication should be /nɪçt/ but I don't hear it.
- [n3] The quality of the *l*, whether it is velarised, is somewhat unclear to me - it should be best to assume velarised in codas immediately following vowels, as in this case.
- [n4] Interesting t-glottalisation.
- [n5] The singer's accent is one where the vowel /ɜ/ is used in *ir*, *er*, *ur* and some *r*s are not pronounced. It should be quite obvious by now. The uncertain *r*s are put in parentheses.
- [n6] It is incredible to hear the three *e* vowels contrast each other here in this line.
- [n7] The word *wit* isn't supposed to sound like this [scots-dict] but it sounds like it rhymes with *get* here.
- [n8] Quality of the vowel in *but* is uncertain, a schwa is my best shot.
- [n9] It was a bit hard to tell apart a syllabic /l/ and a whole /əl/ syllable in this verse.
- [n10] The sandhi here is very light. Presumably, there is another such instance between *death* and *I* (what a poetic thing for linguists to say) but it's apparently even more unnoticeable, so I figured there'd be none.

## Sheet music transcription

This is possibly done before (an alternate version available at [8]), but anyway here it is.

Remarks:
- There are moments where the singer (sort of) anticipates a note by singing it slightly earlier (e.g. the first syllable of *Seton* and *Beaton*) at his artistic discretion, I suppose this does not interfere the correct understanding of how the base melody would look like.
- The placement of a downbeat on the *-mi-* syllable of *Carmichael* made me have a double take on where the lexical stress should lie.
- The *mode* is slightly ambiguous in the sense that we don't know whether the fourth degree is augmented for Lydian (E) or perfect for Ionian (Eb). However, the melody suggests that the harmony should be in plain old Bb major (Ionian mode).
