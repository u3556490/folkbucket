# The Bonny Earl o' Moray
Roud 334, Child 181 [1, child-list]. Other title(s): The Bonnie Earl of Murray [1]

The following uses Rory and Alex McEwen's performance on the 1956 album *Great Scottish Ballads* as the main reference [2].

## Words
This song has as many versions as there are murders in Scotland. The version presented by [2] uses a slightly unorthodox version that has a couple less common verses included. With reference to [1, 3, 4, 11] the lyrics are put together as:

> Ye Hielands and ye Lawlands [n1],  
> O, whaur [n2] hae ye been?  
> You hae slain the Earl o' Moray,  
> And laid him on the green.  
>
> He was a braw callant [n3],  
> And he played at the glove.  
> O the bonny Earl o' Moray,  
> He was the Queen's love.  
>
> (Refrain)  
> O lang may his lady  
> Leuk frae the Castle Doune [n4],  
> Ere she see the Earl o' Moray  
> Come soonding through the toun [n5].  
> 
> Now wae [n6] betide ye, Huntly,  
> And wherefore [n7] did ye sae?  
> I bade you bring him wi you,  
> But forbade ye him tae slay.  
>
> He was a braw callant,  
> And he played at the ring.  
> O the bonny Earl o' Moray,  
> He micht [n8] hae been a king.  
>
> (Refrain)
>
> His lady she cam doun the stair,  
> A-wringing o' [n9] her hand,  
> They hae slain the Earl o' Moray,  
> The flou'r [n10] o' Scotland!  
>
> He was a braw callant,  
> And he played at the ba' [n11].  
> O the bonny Earl o' Moray,  
> Was a flou'r amang them a' [n12].  
>
> (Refrain)

Notes:  
- [n1] *hie* = contraction of *heich*, "high"; *law* is "low". [scots-dict]
- [n2] where [scots-dict]
- [n3] *braw* = "brave" [1], *callant* = "youth, boy [scots-dict], fellow [1]"
- [n4] "look from the Castle Downe". Some other versions may say the last word is *doun* ("down") instead
- [n5] "come sounding through the town"
- [n6] woe [1]
- [n7] a more Scots-native spelling would be *whaurfor*
- [n8] might [scots-dict]
- [n9] this could be *a'* instead, for better grammatical logic
- [n10] contraction of *flouer*, "flower" [scots-dict]
- [n11] ball
- [n12] "was a flower among them all"

Obviously you can find the alternative versions in the references and from Google. Very importantly, the last two verses are rare; though Ewan MacColl included the last one (*was a flouer amang them a'*) [1], the penultimate was found online only at [11]. I hope the transcription works.

As with many songs (cough), this one is about a murder. Without considering the historic authenticity of the Earl of Moray being the Queen's love, there was indeed some truth to some verses: James Stewart, Earl of Moray (Murray), was murdered by his rival the Earl of Huntly in 1592, when the former was accused of plotting against the king [3]. The story is cited in [5, 8, 9]. Following the incident, the public mourned Moray through this song [7], which was apparently first collected in the 18th century [6].

The song repeats a structure of 3 stanzas thrice. While the metre choice is somewhat fluid, each line tends to contain 3 feet, with the refrain being closer to a ballad metre setup.

## Phonetic transcription
This one is rather long.

Notes:  
- [n 1] The *a* in *-lands* sounds more centered, kind of like a schwa. The contrast of the unstressed *a* (as in *-lands*, *-lant* for example) against that of *at*, *an* etc. is a bit tricky
- [n 2] Someone was trying to trill at the end of *Earl*. Also, the vowel *o* in *Moray* is pronounced such that the name sounds like *Murray*
- [n 3] This is not meant to be homophonous with *gallant*
- [n 4] The vowel is a bit off, it's not /lʉk/ but has a Southern England twist to it
- [n 5] The pronunciation is not the expected *whaurfor*
- [n 6] The pronunciation of *cam* (past tense of *come*) can be homophonous with the present tense [scots-dict]. *Stair* is almost like RP pronunciation (the *-r* replaced with a schwa)
- [n 7] There could be sandhi between *hae* and *slain*; one might be inclined to think it's *they had slain*
- [n 8] The stressed vowel in *amang* is halfway between /a/ and /ʌ/

## Sheet music transcription
A very different version is available at [10]. It has been cited as an Irish waltz somewhere (lost the citation, possibly the Google search preview to [11]) and personally I think it's very far from true unless it were the Ulster Scots who brought the tune to Ireland.

Anyway I suppose you know the drill. First verse:

Notes:  
- 6/8 meter was chosen in lieu of 12/8 because it seemed to fit the stanza structure better - every 8 measures is a stanza
- Some of the harmony was harder to hear, but this would do. It is important to use the deceptive-ish cadence at the end (mm. 24)
- Possible chord substitution (mm. 12): do not change chords (stay on B (`V`) instead of going to F#m (`ii`) as in the recording)
- Possible chord substitution (mm. 22): use E (`I`) instead of C#m (`vi`) which was heard in the recording
- In line with the song's melancholic character, more minor chords have been used when compared to the other ballads transcribed thus far
