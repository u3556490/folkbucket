# Bonnie George Campbell
Roud 338, Child 210 [1, child-list]. Other title(s): Bonnie James Campbell [1]

The following uses Rory and Alex McEwen's performance on the 1956 album *Great Scottish Ballads* as the main reference [2].

## Words
This song exists in an excessive amount of variations and not a single one is a spot-on equivalent of the McEwens' version. Piecing together fragments of various renditions [1, 4] and then adding some careful listening, we get:

> High upon Hielands [n1] and laich [n2] upon Tay,  
> Bonnie George Campbell rade [n3] out on a day.  
> Saddled and bridled, sae calland [n4] tae see,  
> Hame cam his guid [n5] horse, but never cam he.  
> 
> Doon [n6] ran his auld mither [n7], greetin' [n8] fu' sair [n9],  
> Out ran his bonnie bride rivin' [n10] her hair;  
> "My meadow lies green and my corn is unshorn [n11],  
> My barn is tae big [n12] and my babe is unborn."  
> 
> Saddled and bridled and booted rade he,  
> A plume [n13] in his helmet, a sword at his knee.  
> But tuim [n14] cam his saddle, a' bloody tae see,  
> Hame cam his guid horse, but never cam he.  
> 
> (repeat 1st verse)

Notes:  
- [n1] highlands
- [n2] low [scots-dict]
- [n3] rode
- [n4] gallant [4]
- [n5] good [scots-dict]
- [n6] down
- [n7] mother
- [n8] weep, cry [scots-dict]
- [n9] sore, sad, grievous
- [n10] to tear, to rend [scots-dict]
- [n11] not sheared [5]
- [n12] this can mean "my barn is to be built" [6]
- [n13] feather [3]
- [n14] empty [scots-dict], also spelled phonetically as "toom" [4]

Other versions of the lyrics can be found at [1, 4, 6, 7, 8]. There is no agreement as to which specific Campbell it was and who murdered him [1, 4, 6, 7, 8], and for something this sinister the melody is rather joyous [a]. A personal bit of commentary is how the relatives of George Campbell are concerned about the work to be done - the meadow, the corn, and the barn to be built; perhaps this reflects the importance of good labour in the olden days?

## Phonetic transcription
Not feeling very confident about this because only 1 hour's effort was put in.

Notes:  
- [n 1] The singers aren't 100% rhotic.
- [n 2] The multiple liaison-styled external sandhi is quite amazing.
- [n 3] A surprisingly Southern pronunciation.
- [n 4] Can be heard as *baby's* instead, equally valid.
- [n 5] The *helmEt* vowel could be /ɛ/ too.
- [n 6] And now the *cam* is pronounced differently...

Notes:  
- For those who seek extra thrill, substitute the harmony in measures 5-6 with `I V7/IV IV iv7`. If you are a pedant, substitute measure 7 and the 1st beat of mm. 4 with `I64`.

## Misc. Notes

- [a] I mean, a common theme of the Child ballads is somebody dies or something bad happens, and for some reason this sort of thing becomes a part of the folk tradition. Do you British people really enjoy deaths so much?
